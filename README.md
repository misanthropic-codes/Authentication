# Authentication Web Application

This project is a simple **Authentication Web Application** built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for user authentication. The application allows users to sign up, log in, and fetch their user information securely.

## Features

1. **Sign Up**:
   - Users can create an account by providing a username and password.
   - The user's data is stored in-memory (in the `users` array).

2. **Sign In**:
   - Users can log in by providing their username and password.
   - On successful authentication, a JWT token is generated and returned to the user.

3. **Get User Information**:
   - Authenticated users can retrieve their account information (username and password) using the JWT token.

4. **Logout**:
   - Users can log out, and the token will be removed from the local storage.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): JavaScript runtime environment.
  - [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Web framework for Node.js.
  - [JWT (JSON Web Token)](https://jwt.io/): For secure authentication.
  
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS for basic structure and styling.
  - [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): Promise-based HTTP client to make API requests.
  - Local storage to save JWT token for authenticated sessions.

## How It Works

### API Endpoints

- **`POST /signup`**:
  - Sign up with a username and password. Example:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "john_doe",
      "password": "123456"
    }
    ```
  
- **`POST /signin`**:
  - Sign in with a valid username and password. Returns a JWT token.
  
- **`GET /me`**:
  - Fetch user information using the JWT token in the `Authorization` header.

### Frontend

The web interface allows users to:

- **Sign Up**: Enter a username and password to register.
- **Sign In**: Log in with an existing username and password, which stores the JWT token in local storage.
- **Fetch User Info**: After signing in, users can fetch their username and password using the "Get User Information" button.
- **Log Out**: Clear the JWT token from local storage and effectively log out the user.

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- **Git** for version control (optional).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

4. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Future Improvements

- Add password encryption for more secure storage.
- Persist user data in a database.
- Enhance the UI for a better user experience.
- Implement password reset functionality.
